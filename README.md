# Inspiration
After doing some research about waste in the household, we found out that the number one cause of waste is air conditioning and heating. We set out to create a system that helps reduce this waste by automating various parameters in the home.

# What it does
The home automation system monitors the status of the home and depending on whether the user is home or away, automates the home's systems to make the house as energy efficient as possible. This prototype focuses on reducing energy waste on air conditioning/heating, which is the number 1 cause of waste in the common household.

# How I built it
We used various sensors and system outputs that pass through an Arduino to a python program/UI. The python program then uses the sensor data to set optimal energy saving settings throughout the house.

# Challenges I ran into
The biggest two problems we faced while developing this product was getting the Arduino IDE to talk to python and creating a power management system that wouldn't overload the Arduino.

# What's next for ThermoState Home Automation System
The next steps for ThermoState would be to develop a full-scale prototype, measure the impact on home energy consumption, and then push it to market.

# Built With
Arduino (C/C++), Python
